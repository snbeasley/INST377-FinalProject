# Maryland Electric Vehicle Adoption: A Data Visualisation
Link to the Github Pages site: https://snbeasley.github.io/

## Description
This project is aimed to visualize the adoption rate of electric vehicles in different counties of Maryland. It is targeted towards modern web browsers including but not limited to Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge, for both desktop and mobile platforms (iOS and Android).

## API
It makes use of the Open Data Maryland API which is found at (https://opendata.maryland.gov/resource/qtcv-n3tc). The API provides data about the electric vehicle registrations by county.

## Visualisations
The page displays a bar chart representing the electric vehicle registration data by county. The visualisations are dynamic and can be filtered based on the county and year selection by the user.

## Libraries and Frameworks
For the visualisation, this project uses Highcharts.js, a javascript charting library. For the front-end presentation, it uses vanilla CSS and HTML.

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to present an easy-to-understand visualisation of the electric vehicle adoption rates in Maryland, providing a county-based perspective that could be useful for people like policymakers, environmentalists, and potential EV buyers. It allows users to filter data based on county and year, which can help track the growth of EV adoption over time and identify areas where EV adoption is lagging or falling behind. As people transition towards emissionless vehicles, it's important to understand the data behind it in order to make the transition smoother and ultimately more effective. 

## Next Steps
1. I could include a separate chart or even have combined charts that include non-Electric Vehicles in order to compare and give a larger overall picture.
2. I could expand this to include other states or even areas of other countries.
